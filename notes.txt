Using serverless framework, we run several functions, giving them  roles and a
database.

we run everything offline in this application..


Just trying to figure out whats outdated in the app...
this code is from 2 years ago


https://dynobase.dev/dynamodb-errors/unable-to-start-dynamodb-local-process/
(for errors revolving around dynamo db local installage)

install plugins, along with "npm installd dynamodb , to get the local database up and running..



This is a full stack application. I am using reactjs for its frontend and i am running the backend on lambda using the serverless framework...
we preconfigure some events using the seeding plugin on dynamodb local.


new update.. instead of using springboot framework for my backend. I use the serverless framework so deploy my application locally...
in the serverless framework I can run many functions, use services on dynamodb such as the creation of tables, insertion/deletion of data using rest api.
I deployed the aws database dynamodb locally.

      quantity: event.quantity,

    },
  };


174019 (λ: getEvent)
× Unhandled exception in handler 'getEvent'.
× data is not defined
× ReferenceError: data is not defined   
->this is because when you use get, an event is invoked to get the info, we need to use event keyword..
